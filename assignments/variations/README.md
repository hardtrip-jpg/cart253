## Description

A fake terminal emulator with some strange games.

##### COOKING:
Use a variety of commands to cook a bowl of Kraft Dinner before the hour runs out. Everything you do takes a minute though! So be quick!

##### RYTHYM:
Use must escape a maze, but the rythym is too strong. Type to the beat or suffer the consequences.

##### OFFICE:
Stuck in a deep down bunker, your only chance of escape is completing some weird maze game on some old terminal. Keep the doors shut or else the monster might get you.
